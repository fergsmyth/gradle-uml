# gradle-uml

###### MVP

The gradle uml plugin should be capable of taking a java source location and generate a UML class diagram describing the relationships between objects in the model.
 
In order to identify which java classes should be model, plugin configuration should accept an annotation or java class name. Using this the class path can be scanned for classes matching the criteria.

It should be possible to capture additional to display that will be displayed as part of the diagram. Again, this can be based of annotation names.
